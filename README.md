# EnMasse
EnMasse allows clients to make bulk searches of their emails on the client side - minimizing the activity needed
on the server side. Users can input a query, and EnMasse will download a copy of all of their emails on the secure
messaging platform and then perform a search against all the data

# Setup

# Developer Notes

# TODO
* Implement ability to store messages locally - allowing multiple searches to occur without re-downloading all
messages
* Add search to include To, From, CC, BCC
* Add options to have exact match instead of only partial match
* Add a GUI using TornadoFX so that this tool can be used by anyone and print outs can be well formatted
* Add ability to direct output to JSON and CSV
